Designed and implemented a terminal-based platformer game in C++, drawing inspiration from the Super Mario series. The game features three distinct levels, each introducing progressively challenging enemies as the player advances. The project involved:

Implementing core game mechanics such as jumping, running, and collision detection using custom C++ algorithms.
Developing a level design system to create and load three unique game levels within the terminal.
Implementing increasing enemy difficulty across the levels, with stronger enemy types appearing in later levels.
Handling user input for character control and game interactions.
Optimizing rendering for the terminal environment using character-based graphics.
The project, totaling over 3500 lines of C++ code, showcases strong problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in C++ programming within a constrained environment.
